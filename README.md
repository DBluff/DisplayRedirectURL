# DisplayRedirectURL

My site runs on both Drupal and WordPress and has a large folder structure used to organize different departments. We use a great deal of 301 redirects to make it possible for departments to advertise specific pages. This code will query the db for the vanity (301) url and display it on the page for both Wordpress and Drupal.
